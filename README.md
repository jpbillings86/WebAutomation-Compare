# WebAutomation-Compare
The purpose of this project is to practice and show side by side what various automation solutions COULD look like for the exact same project. To do this, I will plan a common set of scenarios against a site and then automate those scenarios using the following frameworks:

- Robot Framework
- Playwright
- Cypress
- Capybara/RSpec
- Java/Selenium
